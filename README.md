# 游꿀 EN2130 Communication Design Project 游꿀

Excited to share our completed 3rd-semester communication design project for the module EN2130 at Electronic and Telecom Engineering - University of Moratuwa!

## 游니 Project Focus
We implemented a secure and reliable point-to-point digital wired/wireless communication system using software-defined radios. Our achievements include the successful transmission and reception of diverse data types, such as images, text, and real-time audio.

## 游댌 Our Approach
- 游니 **Image Transmission:** Utilized BPSK modulation and demodulation, incorporating CRC error correction to ensure data integrity.
- 游니 **Binary Data Stream Transmission:** Employed Forward Error Correction (FEC) techniques to minimize errors and enhance transmission reliability.
- 游니 **Audio Transmission:** Applied Narrowband Frequency Modulation (NBFM) for high-quality voice transmission in real-time.

## 游댢 Project Setup
- 游니 **Software Tools:** We extensively used MATLAB Simulink during our laboratory procedures to gain knowledge and familiarity with wireless communications.
- 游니 **Implementation:** Our team then leveraged GNU Radio software to simulate virtual channels and implement the wireless communication system using a Software-Defined Radio (SDR) in Blade-RF and Streamlit for the user interface.
- 游니 **Security:** Advanced techniques such as symmetric key encryption were integrated to ensure the security of our communication system.
